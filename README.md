# PixDeck

**Stream live data, games, and ambient visuals to your Ulanzi Pixbar (TC002) — a 52×16 RGB pixel clock — from a local web app. No firmware flashing.**

## Quick start

You need **Python 3** and a Pixbar / TC002 on the same Wi-Fi as your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cailurus/PixDeck.git
cd PixDeck
python3 pixbar_panel.py
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000**, click the gear, and enter your clock's IP — it's remembered across restarts. No `npm`, no `pip install`.

> Prefer the command line? `python3 pixbar_panel.py --device <IP> --port 8000` sets it up front.

## What you can put on the clock

Toggle any of these from the web app — each runs as a small plugin pushing frames to the device:

- **Info** — US stocks, crypto prices, live weather, system monitor (CPU/RAM/GPU/disk — this machine, or a remote LAN box like a NAS via a tiny agent; see [plugins/sysmon](./plugins/sysmon/)), now-playing track, Claude Code session status
- **Games** (AI plays itself) — snake, pong, breakout, pac-man
- **Visuals** — a pixel cat, starfield, falling sand, fire, Langton's ant, auto-solving maze, fish tank
- **Tools** — a scrolling notice board for any message you type
- **Scheduled** — hourly chime, timed reminders, now-playing song-change announcements

There's also a **Canvas** tab: a 52×16 pixel editor to draw by hand, stamp text, or load and pixelize a logo, then push the frame straight to the clock.

## How it works

A local server (`pixbar_panel.py`, pure Python standard library) runs each plugin in a thread, serves the web app, and proxies the device's HTTP API — all bound to `127.0.0.1`. Your browser talks only to this local server, which talks to your clock over the LAN. Plugins live in `plugins/<name>/` and are auto-discovered.

You can also switch the push transport to **MQTT** in Settings — frames are published to `<prefix>/custom/<app>` on your broker instead of POSTed over HTTP (the frame format is identical, so every plugin works either way). This needs an MQTT broker that both the app and the clock connect to; the topic prefix comes from the device's own MQTT config.

> **Works with the device's official (stock) firmware only.** PixDeck drives the clock through that firmware's *Custom App HTTP protocol* — which is exactly why it needs no flashing. A reflashed / custom firmware would drop that protocol and would not work with PixDeck unless it reimplemented it.
